For example, if supporters hold 10,000 U of funds, the ratio of Metaverse Allocation Company is 1:10, and Metaverse Allocation Company can provide another 90,000 U of funds, that is, after the allocation A total of 100,000 U can be used to enjoy the rebate benefits. 3% of the profit can be up to 30% after the allocation. This provides a way for Metaverse supporters to rapidly expand their profits. After Metaverse is allocated, supporters can expand their income, and can quickly recover the profit from the cost.<br>\nAdvantage 2: The threshold for starting allocation is very low. Metaverse allocation companies can generally magnify 10 times to 100 times. Unlike margin financing and securities lending, the financing threshold is very high. Generally, the initial cooperation can only be carried out at 1:1 or 1:5. This discourages many small-cap investors.<br>\nAdvantage 3: Low commissions for cryptocurrency transactions. The trading accounts used by Metaverse Allocation generally have relatively low trading commissions, which also saves investors some expenses.<br>\nAdvantage 4: The trading account of Metaverse Partners is risk-controlled by both partners, and Metaverse Partners effectively provides risk control assistance.<br>\nAdvantage 5: After the daily income settlement, the customer's profit funds can be transferred to the (customer) wallet account within 10-30 minutes, which is fast and convenient.<br>\nThe final interpretation right belongs to our company\n        ":o?"\n1.Binance Cloud Mining:<br>\n\n1.
